### 4. Why is the blockchain important ?
- To run this project, the blockchain is important because it is safer than the regular web marketplace. Every transaction is reported on the blockcain and it is easy to find them. The market of art can be a good example because the original NFT can be stored on a blockchain.
- The blockchain can be useful for many projects. Indeed, it is a good way to keep, a picture for example, secure
